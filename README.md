# Adaptive Architecture with dapr

Intro to dapr - https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/overview/

# Setup
The following components are necessary to run the example.

- Container runtime (Docker): https://www.docker.com/get-started/
- Portable, event-driven runtime (dapr): https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/
- Single node k8s (minikube): https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/


The following components are optional, are only needed if the example is run via `apr-cli`.

- The programming language with the nice mascot **golang**: https://go.dev/dl/
- The versatile technology from Microsoft **.NET**: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

# dapr cli
The installation is straight-forward, just follow the instructions mentioned above.

0. Dapr init

The first step is to initialize dapr. As a result dapr itself and the corresponding dapr runtime is installed.

**Hint**: Docker needs to run!

```bash
# kick-start dapr
dapr init

# check the version
dapr --version
CLI version: 1.7.1
Runtime version: 1.7.3
```

After the initial dapr setup the example can be executed using the `dapr-cli`. A prerequisite for this step is the installation of the golang/.NET SDKs (again see above for the installation link/info).

1. Via Makefile (Unix-like systems)

To simplify this process open two terminal windows and execute the following make commands.

```bash
# terminal1
mage agent-cli

# terminal2
make dashboard-cli
```

To verify if all works as expected open a browser windows with the following URL: ```http://localhost:9000```.

**HINT**: If you get an error concerning the port this might be caused by a process already having possession of the port :9000.

2. Via Powershell (Windows)

For the Windows-people the process works the same, open two terminal/powershell/... windows and execute the powershell scripts.

```bash
# terminal1
.\dapr-agent-cli.ps1

# terminal2
.\dapr-dashboard-cli.ps1
```

Again verify the correct execution of the processes by opening a browser window with the URL: ```http://localhost:9000```.

The output will be similar to this:

# dapr on k8s

The easiest way to work with kubernetes/k8s is to locally install minikube, a single-node kubernetes "cluster". The installation is again rather simple and can be easily performed on Windows, Mac, Linux.

1. minikube

Install minikube according to documentation: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

Afterwards startup minikube. The output will be similar to the one shown below:

```bash
> minikube start

😄  minikube v1.25.2 on Darwin 12.4 (arm64)

💡  After the addon is enabled, please run "minikube tunnel" and your ingress resources would be available at "127.0.0.1"
    ▪ Using image k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/kube-webhook-certgen:v1.1.1
    ▪ Using image k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.1.1

🔎  Verifying ingress addon...
🌟  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass, dashboard, ingress
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

To work with k8s/minikube `kubectl` is needed. Minikube provides a kubectl `minikube kubectl -- <kubectl commands>`. In addition it is possible to install a plain kubectl. This can be done by typical packages managers. For Windows [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) is quite nice (or winget for newer Windows versions).

```bash
# Mac
brew install kubectl

# Windows
scoop install kubectl
```

This is optional, because the minikube-provided kubectl can also be used, or aliased to "feel" like a standalone kubectl (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/kubectl/). 


2. dapr on k8s

The process is again quite easy. More information is available on the dapr website: https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/cluster/setup-minikube/.
The following additional components are installed on minikube:

```bash
minikube addons enable dashboard
minikube addons enable ingress
```

The finial step to initialize dapr on k8s is done via the `dapr-cli`.

```bash
dapr init -k
```

This command deploys the necessary containers to have the dapr environment available on minikube.

3. dapr components pubsub

A pubsub component is needed on k8s/minikube for this example. The easiest way is to install `redis` by using the `helm-cli` (dapr-docu: https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/tutorials/configure-state-pubsub/)

3.1 Install helm-cli

The helm-documentation lists a number of options how to install helm for different operating-systems: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

3.2 Install redis

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm install redis bitnami/redis
```

Once the commands executed successfully check the relevant pods are running:

```bash
> kubectl get pods
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
redis-master-0     1/1     Running   1 (35m ago)   2d23h
redis-replicas-0   1/1     Running   2 (34m ago)   2d23h
redis-replicas-1   1/1     Running   2 (34m ago)   2d23h
redis-replicas-2   1/1     Running   2 (34m ago)   2d23h
```

3.3 dapr pubsub component

The last step is to "introduce" the pubsub dapr component to k8s. The definition of the component is stored in `deployment/pubsub.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: pubsub
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: pubsub.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    secretKeyRef:
      name: redis
      key: redis-password
 # uncomment below for connecting to redis cache instances over TLS (ex - Azure Redis Cache)
  # - name: enableTLS
  #   value: true

```

This "typical" yaml structure is the applied via `kubectl` using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./deployment/pubsub.yaml
```

Again this can be done by using the Makefile:

```bash
make kube-deploy
```

Or for the Windows-people by using the following powershell script:

```bash
.\k8s-deploy-pubsub.ps1
```

The result can be verified by listing the component via `kubectl`:

```bash
> kubectl get components
NAME     AGE
pubsub   2d23h
```

4. deploy components and service

To deploy the logic as containers to k8s/minikube another yaml definition is needed. The yaml files creates deployments for two pods and a service to access the dashboard (via ingress). The syntax is typical k8s-yaml (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/) with some dapr-extensions:

```yaml
annotations:
    dapr.io/enabled: "true"
    dapr.io/app-id: "dashboard"
    dapr.io/app-port: "9000"
spec:
    containers:
    - name: dashboard
      image: dapr-demo/dashboard:latest
      ports:
      - containerPort: 9000
      imagePullPolicy: Never
```

The `app-port` and `containerPort` are kind of used twice, just ensure that the same ports are used. The deployment file is available at: `deployment/components.yaml` and is applied via

```bash
kubectl -f apply ./deployment/components.yaml
```

To access the dashboard a k8s service is defined: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dashboard-service
  labels:
    app: dashboard-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: dashboard
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 9000
    targetPort: 9000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

The service definition exposes a TCP port which binds/forwars to the node and port of the container. This is necessary to access the system and the logic within the container from the "outside".

Minikube has a speciality, that additional work is needed to access services, because no "public IP" is created with minikube (this is different with other k8s implementations). But there is an easy way to access the service - minikube has a `tunnel` command which establishes a tunnel to the exposed service. In fact it creates a tunnel to the LoadBalancer where services are exposed (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/commands/tunnel/)

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

The terminal-window with the `tunnel` command needs to stay opened, this enables access to the defined port on **localhost**. So if a browser-window is opened (http://localhost:9000) the dashboard HTML/SignalR UI is displayed.


## Local images
The application images are not published to dockerhub or any other container-registry, because this would just be waste for this demo-purpose. Instead the images are held locally and k8s is instructed to **not pull** the images!

To build locally a Makefile is available:

```bash
# unix-like
make build-container

# windows
.\docker-build.ps1
```
creates the local images.


```yaml
containers:
- name: dashboard
  image: dapr-demo/dashboard:latest
  ports:
  - containerPort: 9000
  imagePullPolicy: Never
```

The important part is the **imagePullPolicy**. To actually enable this, it is not sufficient to just build the images locally, because minikube does not access those local images. As usual there is an [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56392041/getting-errimageneverpull-in-pods) how to give the images to minikube!

The trick is to set some relevant ENVs via minikube and build again:

```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

On __Windows__ and __powershell__ this translates to

```
minikube docker-env --shell powershell | Invoke-Expression
```
